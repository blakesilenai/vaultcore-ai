# VaultCore.ai

**GitOps-native orchestration engine** for spacecraft-ground automation, real-time data flows, and 3D mission modeling.

## 🚀 Overview

VaultCore is the mission orchestration layer for next-generation spacecraft operations. It combines:

- **Git-based automation workflows** for repeatable, version-controlled operations
- **Kubernetes + Terraform** for declarative infrastructure and hybrid cloud deployments
- **3D real-time system visualization** to map operational states, data flows, and spacecraft topology
- **Kafka + Kinesis** for high-throughput event streaming and telemetry pipelines
- **Optional procedural automation** powered by [SonataFlow](https://sonataflow.dev/) / Kogito BPMN
